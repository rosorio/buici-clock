The best clock on the Internet that I found didn't look good enough.
I designed (am designing) Buici to be attractive, configurable, and
easy to use.

This release patches a couple of bugs, adds support for window manager
communication (ICCCM), and improves geometry parsing.  If this one
encounters no crash bugs, I'll be adding configurability from a
dialog.  Yep, there's a dialog manager in there somewhere.

Please check the release notes in the README for information on the
problems I working to erradicate.  If you have any difficulties please
send me e-mail with a description of the problem andx the output of the
info.sh script.
