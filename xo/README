  1.  Introduction

  This is a C++ class library I use to support a collection of
  X-Windows applications.  I don't use the Xt and other like libraries
  because they're bigger and much more complex that this one.  Also,
  I'm working toward a device-independent user interface library so it
  is easier to perform dialogs and handle varying screen dimensions.

  1.2  Feedback and Bug Reports

  Bug reports may be sent to the author at <elf@netcom.com>.  There is
  a plan to incorporate some form of automatic bug report generation
  within the application, but until that is available e-mail is
  likely to produce the best response.
